Google ML Crash Course Code
===========================

This is code I'm copying from the [Google ML Crash Course](https://developers.google.com/machine-learning/crash-course/).  I am:

- getting it running locally
- refactoring to make the code fit my head better

## Running it yourself

You will need to install Python 3, [install pipenv](https://docs.pipenv.org/) and then, in a terminal in the root of the repo, run:

```
pipenv install
pipenv shell
```

That should install all required packages (including tensorflow) and then you can do things like:

```
python tensorflow-first-steps/first_steps_2.py
```
